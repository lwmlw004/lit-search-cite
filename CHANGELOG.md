## [1.0.11] — 2026-06-15

### Changed
- `SKILL.md`: MCP-first workflow — `ai4scholar` MCP (Semantic Scholar + Google Scholar) and `scansci-pdf` MCP are now the **primary paths**; Playwright scripts (`cnki-playwright.py`, `google-scholar.py`) demoted to optional/advanced. Google Scholar MCP replaces `google-scholar.py` entirely (no setup, no cookies, headless). `scansci-pdf` + CARSI replaces `cnki-playwright.py --download`. Source selection table rewritten around MCP tools. Mode 1/2/3/5 all lead with MCP calls.

## [1.0.10] — 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- Windows GBK console encoding crash (`UnicodeEncodeError`) in `multi-search.py`, `journal-rank.py`, `pdf-fetch.py` when printing non-ASCII characters (e.g., author names with diacritics) — added `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8', errors='replace')` on win32 (note: `google-scholar.py` and `cnki-playwright.py` already had this fix)

---

## [1.0.9] — 2026-06-15

### Added
- `cli.js` replaces `install.js`: fixes `--all` flag bug (previously installed 0 locations), adds `--help` / `-h`, `--version` / `-v`, proper exit codes
- `package.json`: added `bin` field (`lit-search-cite` → `cli.js`) to fix `npx` "could not determine executable" warning; added `files`, `author`, `repository` object fields
- `google-scholar.py`: Google Scholar via Playwright; one-time setup, headless after; supports `--query`, `--limit`, `--since`, `--until`, `--status`, `--login-only`
- `cnki-playwright.py`: built-in VPN URL lookup for ~100 Chinese universities; `--db` flag for database selection; PDF download via browser `fetch()` (VPN cookie-aware); debug screenshot on failure
- `check-deps.ps1`: 12-item dependency and config checker
- `scripts/setup.ps1`: API key wizard with `-Show` and `-Reset` flags; stores 8 keys including `wos`
- `references/mcp-template.json`: copy-paste MCP config template

### Changed
- `SKILL.md`: updated description to eval-optimized version; corrected Mode 5 PDF download (scansci-pdf primary, pdf-fetch fallback for DOI only); added `google-scholar.py` usage examples; fixed journal-rank.py note (requires OneScholar key, no silent offline fallback)
- `README.md`: rewritten based on actual source code; corrected script list and capabilities
- `AGENTS.md`: rewritten; fixed undefined `$SKILL_DIR` in manual installation; corrected Hermes note; accurate feature table
- `references/setup-guide.md`: rewritten; added Google Scholar step; corrected school count (~100); accurate config file schema
- `references/api-setup.md`: added missing Path H (Wanfang API); fixed api table ordering; corrected PowerShell examples
- `references/search-strategies.md`: added `multi-search.py` domain routing table; corrected arXiv category list; added CNKI `--db` note
- `references/optional-apis.md`: added Wanfang section; clarified journal-rank offline DB scope; corrected OneScholar note

### Fixed
- `--all` flag in `cli.js` now correctly installs to all 3 platforms
- `npx lit-search-cite` no longer shows "could not determine executable" warning
- CHANGELOG was stuck at v1.0.0 while package was at v1.0.9
